# Guidelines for Contributing Code

At New Relic we welcome community code contributions our open source project,
and have taken effort to make this process easy for both contributors and our
development team. Because of this, we need to be more defensive in our coding
practices than most projects.

Contributions are always welcome. Before contributing please read the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [search the issue tracker](issues); your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in `main`. To contribute,
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository, commit your changes, and [send a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Note that our [code of conduct](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all platforms and venues related to this project; please follow it in all your interactions with the project and its participants.

## Testing

The plugin includes a suite of functional tests which should be used to
verify your changes don't break existing functionality.

Functional tests are stored in the `test` directory.

### Running Tests

Running the test suite is simple.  Just invoke:

    npm install
    npm test

This will run the tests in standalone mode, executing the test suite.

### Writing Tests

For most contributions it is strongly recommended to add additional tests which
exercise your changes.

This helps us efficiently incorporate your changes into our mainline codebase
and provides a safeguard that your change won't be broken by future development.

There are some rare cases where code changes do not result in changed
functionality (e.g. a performance optimization) and new tests are not required.
In general, including tests with your pull request dramatically increases the
chances it will be accepted.


## Feature Requests

You are welcome to send pull requests to us - however, by doing so you agree that you are granting New Relic a non-exclusive, non-revokable, no-cost license to use the code, algorithms, patents, and ideas in that code in our products if we so choose. You also agree the code is provided as-is and you provide no warranties as to its fitness or correctness for any purpose.

Feature requests should be submitted in the [Issue tracker](../../issues), with a description of the expected behavior & use case, where they’ll remain closed until sufficient interest, [e.g. :+1: reactions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/), has been [shown by the community](../../issues?q=label%3A%22votes+needed%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
Before submitting an Issue, please search for similar ones in the
[closed issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aenhancement).

## Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Contributor License Agreement

Keep in mind that when you submit your Pull Request, you'll need to sign the CLA via the click-through using CLA-Assistant. If you'd like to execute our corporate CLA, or if you have any questions, please drop us an email at opensource@newrelic.com.
